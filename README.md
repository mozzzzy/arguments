# arguments
Argument option parser for go.  

## What is this
I always have to write codes for following operations.  
1. Parse argument options.
2. Handle following situations.
	- Our required options are not provided.
	- The specified options are invalid to use.

So I aggregate codes to provide above operations to this package.
